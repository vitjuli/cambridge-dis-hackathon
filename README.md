# FactTrace Hackathon @ University of Cambridge
## 🧠 Agentic AI Jury Hackathon
Welcome to the AI Jury Hackathon!

In this hackathon, you’ll design a jury of AI agents that evaluates whether a statement faithfully represents a given fact or mutates it.
This is a fast, hands-on challenge focused on reasoning, disagreement, and trust, not infrastructure or large-scale systems.

## Challenge
### 🚩 The Core Problem
You will be given pairs of statements:
1. Internal Fact
A factual statement (e.g. from a report, paper, dataset, or trusted source)

2. External Interpretation
A statement derived from that fact (e.g. a summary, headline, tweet, or claim)

#### Your task is to answer:
> **Is the external claim a faithful representation of the internal fact — or a mutation?**

This is harder than it sounds. Mutations can happen in many ways, including but not limited to:

Most cases are borderline by design.
People can disagree on whether the meaning has changed.

#### What Counts as a “Mutation”?
-Shifts in certainty or commitment
-Numerical rounding or threshold changes
-Scope or population drift
-Causality vs correlation confusion
-Changes in tone, strength, or implication
-Missing qualifiers or conditions

There is no single ground truth.
Your agentic jury must reason — not just classify.

### ⚖️ Build an AI Jury

You will design a **multi-agent system** - an *AI jury*.
A valid jury:
-Has multiple agents with distinct roles
-Allows agents to analyze, disagree, and refine

and it produces: 

- a verdict  
- an explanation
- a signal of uncertainty
  
🚫 A single LLM call in a loop is not sufficient.

This is not about being **“right at all costs.”**  It is about reasoning **transparently and responsibly** to reach the verdict. 

---
### 🏁 Data Usage
You do not need to use all the data.

Instead, teams must:

1. Select a specific subset of the dataset
2. Justify why that subset is interesting or difficult
3. Apply multi-agent reasoning to it
   
Recommended subset size
- 10-20 claim pairs
  
Example valid subsets
- One domain (e.g. clinical, business, policy)
- One mutation type (e.g. numerical rounding, modality shift)
- One high-ambiguity subset (explicitly labeled in the CSV)
  
📁 The dataset is pre-categorized by:
- Domain
- Mutation type
- Ambiguity level
- High-ambiguity subset
  
Use these categories strategically.

---
### 🏁 Expected Output

By the end of the hackathon, your team should be able to:

- Demo a working AI jury built using multiple agents
- Show how agents reason, including where they agree or disagree
- Evaluate up to 5 (fact, claim) pairs, producing for each:
  - A final verdict
  - A concise, human-readable explanation
- Demonstrate that the approach generalizes beyond the presented examples
  (i.e., it is not hard-coded to specific cases)
- Explicitly communicate uncertainty whenever the evidence or agent reasoning is inconclusive


### Demos can be:
- CLI output  
- Notebook  
- Minimal UI  

> *Simple is great - clarity matters more than polish.*

##⏱️ The 5-Minute Demo Rule

Your solution should be understandable in 5 minutes or less.

A strong demo typically shows:

1. The chosen data subset
2. Agent roles and interaction
3. five concrete claim evaluations
4. Where agents agree, disagree, or defer
5. How does your system generalize
   
If it can’t be explained in 5 minutes, it’s probably too complex.

## 🏆 Judging criteria 

Projects will be judged on:

#🧠 Agent Design (30%)
- Clear, purposeful agent roles
- Meaningful interaction (not just chaining)
- Evidence of added value vs single-agent baseline
#🧾 Reasoning & Explanation (30%)
- Clear, honest explanations
- Explicit handling of uncertainty
- Insight into why a case is hard
#🔍 Data Understanding (20%)
- Thoughtful subset selection
- Correct identification of mutation types
- Awareness of ambiguity
#🎤 Demo Clarity (20%)
- Clear structure
- Easy to follow
- Teaches the judges something

We care more about **good reasoning** than perfect answers.

### A golden solution is:
- Clearly better than a single-agent baseline  
- Understandable in a 3-minute demo  
- Teaches you something about multi-agent value  
- Handles uncertainty responsibly  

---

## 🧠 Important Question

During your demo, be prepared to answer:

> **What did using multiple agents add compared to a single AI call?**

There is no “correct” answer — **thoughtful reflections are highly valued**.

---

## 🚀 Possible Extension Direction

Beyond defining agent roles, one way to extend your jury’s capabilities is by giving agents access to **tools** — either by creating simple custom tools or by integrating existing ones.

If you choose to explore this path, you may find the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** useful.

That said, tooling is optional. Extensions can take many forms, and you are encouraged to explore any idea that can improve your jury system.

## ⏱️ Timebox & Mindset

This is a short, intense hackathon.

Aim for:

- A working prototype  
- One strong idea  
- A clear demo  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to build? Here is everything you need to set up your environment, choose your tools, and manage your API usage.

---

### 1. The Repository

Everything you need to begin—including the required datasets, skeleton files, and setup instructions—is in the official hackathon repository.

👉 **Fork the Repository on GitHub**

All teams are expected to build on top of this repository to ensure a consistent baseline for evaluation.

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Frameworks

You are free to use any **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** framework you prefer, such as:

- AutoGen  
- CrewAI  
- LangGraph  

If you are new to building agents, we recommend **LangChain**.

**Why?**  
It makes composing agents quick and intuitive.

📚 **Docs:** [LangChain Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com)

---

## API Keys
> _(Loubna and James to review — feel free to change this part as necessary)_

To access the LLM services required for your agents, you will use your own API keys. We recommend **OpenAI** for its ease of use and documentation, though you are free to use **Anthropic**, **Gemini**, or others.

💰 **Reimbursement Policy**  
We will reimburse API costs incurred during the event up to **£[X] per team**.  
Please save your usage receipts or screenshots for submission at the end of the event.

📉 **Tips to keep costs low:**

- **Use efficient models:**  
  Start with cheaper models (e.g., `gpt-5-nano` or `gpt-5-mini`) for testing, and only switch to flagship models (e.g., `gpt-5`) for final, distinct tasks.
- **Limit your Jury:**  
  When testing, reduce the number of agents in your loop.
- **Watch the loop:**  
  Ensure your code has clear *exit conditions* to avoid infinite retry loops that drain credits.
- **Set hard limits:**  
  Configure a hard budget limit in your API provider’s dashboard to prevent accidental overspending.

## 🎯 Final Thought

Facts rarely break in obvious ways.  
They often break through **interpretation**.

Your job is to design an AI system that notices when that happens.

**Good luck — and have fun building your jury.**
