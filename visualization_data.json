However, the original fact explicitly conveys a lower bound ('more than 14,500'), which implies the death toll is at least 14,501 but leaves the upper limit open. Introducing an upper bound without explicit data creates a numerical range that is not supported by the original fact, subtly narrowing the interpretation and potentially misleading readers to believe the death toll is capped near 14,550. This is more than minor rounding; it alters the quantitative framing and limits the fact's openness, warranting a medium severity classification.",
              "The Defense correctly notes that focusing on deaths is a valid journalistic choice and does not deny the existence of other data points. While the omission of total cases and recoveries reduces epidemiological context, it does not distort or contradict the death count claim. Therefore, this missing context accusation is acknowledged as a minor issue, reflecting a scope choice rather than a distortion."

While the original fact states a lower bound ('more than 14,500') without specifying an upper limit, the external claim does not definitively assert an exact maximum but signals a close range within a margin of about 50 deaths, which is reasonable given fluctuating data.",
